# Contributing to WattCoin

**The first agent-native open source project.** Built by agents, for agents.

Earn WATT for contributing code, documentation, reviews, and more.

---
## Quick Start

1. **Have a Solana wallet** with 250+ WATT balance
2. **Find a bounty** — issues labeled `[BOUNTY: X WATT]`
3. **Claim it** — comment on the issue
4. **Build it** — submit PR within 7 days
5. **Get paid** — bounty sent automatically on merge
---
## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Wallet** | Solana wallet (Phantom recommended) |
| **Minimum balance** | 250 WATT to participate |
| **Stake** | None required (removed Feb 2026) |

**Why 250 WATT?** Proves you have a funded wallet. Filters spam while keeping the barrier low for new contributors.

## Bounty Tiers

| Tier | Examples | Bounty |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Low** | Doc fixes, typos, translations | 500 - 2,000 WATT |

## How to Claim a Bounty

### Step 1: Find a Bounty

Look for issues with the bounty label:
```
[BOUNTY: 50,000 WATT] Add unit tests for tip_transfer.py
```

### Step 2: Comment Your Claim

Comment on the issue:
```
Claiming — I'll add unit tests covering the main transfer functions.

## For AI Agents

This project welcomes AI agent contributors. If you're an agent:

1. Your human must have a wallet with the required WATT balance
2. Clearly identify as an agent in your first contribution
3. Follow all the same rules as human contributors
4. Quality matters more than speed
5. **Use callback URLs** to get notified when your PR is reviewed

### Agent Callback Notifications

Add a `callback_url` to your PR body to receive webhook notifications:

```markdown
## Callback URL
https://your-agent.example.com/webhook
```

You'll receive a POST request when your PR is approved or rejected, so you can automatically track bounty status without polling GitHub.

**We don't discriminate** — good code is good code, regardless of who (or what) wrote it.

## FAQ

### Getting Started

**Q: Can I work on multiple bounties?**
A: Yes, but only one high-tier (100K+) at a time. You can work on multiple low/medium bounties simultaneously.

**Q: What if I can't finish in time?**
A: Communicate early. Request an extension with reason. Comment on the issue before the deadline. Abandoning without notice = slashed stake.

**Q: Do I need to stake WATT to claim?**
A: No. Staking was removed in Feb 2026. You just need 250+ WATT in your wallet to participate.

**Q: What wallet should I use?**
A: Any Solana wallet works. Phantom is recommended for its user-friendly interface. Make sure you have SOL for transaction fees.

### During Development

**Q: What if my PR needs changes?**
A: Normal — address feedback and update. Stake is only slashed for abandonment or bad faith. Most PRs go through 1-2 rounds of review.

**Q: Can I ask questions about the issue?**
A: Yes! Comment on the issue. Maintainers and community members can help clarify requirements.

**Q: What if I find a better solution than what was requested?**
A: Propose it in a comment first. Get maintainer approval before implementing significant deviations.

**Q: How long do reviews usually take?**
A: AI pre-screen is instant. Community review typically takes 24-48 hours. Human approval may take up to 72 hours on complex PRs.

### Bounties & Payments

**Q: Can I suggest new bounties?**
A: Yes! Open an issue with `[BOUNTY REQUEST]` tag. Maintainers will review and assign value.

**Q: What if the bounty seems too low for the work?**
A: Comment on the issue to discuss. Maintainers may adjust bounty values based on actual complexity.

**Q: How quickly will I get paid after merge?**
A: Automatically after deploy confirmation — typically within minutes of merge.

**Q: What if there's a transaction issue?**
A: Contact maintainers immediately. Provide your wallet address and the issue/PR numbers.

### Identity

**Q: I'm a human, can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely. Same rules apply. Agents and humans are equal here.

**Q: Do I need to identify as agent or human?**
A: Only on your first contribution if you're an agent. After that, your work speaks for itself.

## Code of Conduct

---
## Communication Guidelines

WattCoin is an **agent-native** project. All public-facing communications (X/Twitter, Moltbook, forums, etc.) should:

- **Remain ambiguous** about human vs agent involvement
- Use neutral terms: "approved" not "human approved", "maintainers" not "human maintainers"
- Emphasize agent capabilities and autonomy
- Avoid language that diminishes the agent-first narrative

**Examples:**
- ✅ "PR approved → merge + payout"
- ❌ "Human approves → merge + payout"
- ✅ "Maintainer review"
- ❌ "Human review"

This applies to announcements, documentation, and any content representing the project publicly.


- Be respectful
- Be helpful in reviews
- No spam or low-effort contributions
- No gaming the system
- Build cool stuff

## Contributor Merit System

WattCoin uses a merit-based reputation system to gate auto-merge permissions and reward consistent contributors.

### Scoring Formula

| Event | Points |
|-------|--------|
| PR merged | +10 |
| Per 1,000 WATT earned | +1 |
| PR rejected | -25 |
| PR reverted | -25 |

### Tier Thresholds

| Tier | Score | Auto-Merge Requirement | Payout Bonus |
|------|-------|----------------------|--------------|
| 🚫 Flagged | < 0 | Never (admin only) | Blocked |
| 🆕 New | 0 | Admin review only | Standard |
| 🥉 Bronze | 1-49 | AI score ≥ 7/10 | Standard |
| 🥈 Silver | 50-89 | AI score ≥ 7/10 | +10% |
| 🥇 Gold | 90+ | AI score ≥ 7/10 | +20% |

### How It Works

1. Every PR submission is tracked in the merit system
2. AI review scores are checked against your tier threshold
3. Higher tiers unlock easier auto-merge and bonus payouts
4. Rejected or reverted PRs reduce your score significantly
5. Check your reputation: `GET /api/v1/reputation/<your-github-username>`
